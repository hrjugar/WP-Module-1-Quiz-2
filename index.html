            <h1>HI! I'M HERNAN.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I'm a 19-years old college student studying at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I'm in my second year now, taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                <br> <br>
                I like technology. I'm fascinated by how anything can be made or done by applying scientific ideas. I find it crazy how humanity continues to invent new things after doing it a million times before.
                <br> <br>
                Needless to say, I also like programming. It's one of the most interesting technological inventions I've ever seen. It's mind-boggling how it works: you only need to type code to produce output. It doesn't have a medieval equivalent; if people in medieval times saw it, they would've probably thought it was magic.
                <br> <br>
                That doesn't mean I code the whole day though. Even magicians don't cast spells just because they can. In my spare time, I'm pretty much the same as everyone else. I only do simple activities. I play video games, watch YouTube, read manga, listen to music, and do all other generic actions that could be thought of. Sometimes, I read books, hang out with my friends, or wander in the city, but I haven't been able to do them ever since quarantine started.</p>
